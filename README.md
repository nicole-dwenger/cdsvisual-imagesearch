## Description

> This project relates to Assignment 2: Visual Image Search of the course Visual Analytics

The purpose of the project was develop a tool to find similar images to a given target image. This can be useful to identify duplicates or sort images in clusters. Further, it could be practically implemented as an image recommender, i.e., *if you like this image, you might also like these images*.

This repository contains scripts for two different methods to find images which are similar to a target image (1) using olor histograms and (2) using transfer learning, i.e. feature embeddings extracted from the pretrained model VGG16. The aim of developing scripts for two different methods was also to compare of their outputs and usability, which are discussed below. 


## Methods

### Data
For this project, the [Oxford-17 flowers image dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/) was used. This dataset contains 80 images for 17 different categories (total of 1360 images). 

### 1.  Image search using color histograms
Images can be represented by their distribution of color. In an RGB color space, color histograms display the how often each pixel intensity (between 0-255) occurs in each of the three color channels for a given image. These distributions can be compared using different distance metrics. The script in this repository extracts color distributions of each of the images and identifies similar images using the chi-square distance measure.

### 2. Image search using image embeddings
Pre-trained CNNs can be used to extract image embeddings. In other words, pre-trained weights are used to predict a dense feature space, i.e., vector for each image. These vectors can be compared to find images which are visually similar. In this project, the pre-trained model VGG16 is used to extract features of each image. These feature representations are then fed into a k Nearest Neighbour algorithm, to find the k most similar images to a given target image.

```


## Usage 

**!** The scripts have only been tested on Linux, using Python 3.6.9. 


### 1. Cloning the Repository and Installing Dependencies

To run the scripts, I recommend cloning this repository and installing necessary dependencies in a virtual environment. The bash script `create_venv.sh` can be used to create a virtual environment called `venv_imagesearch` with all necessary dependencies, listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The following commands can be used:

```bash
# cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/nicole-dwenger/cdsvisual-imagesearch.git

# move into directory
cd cdsvisual-imagesearch

# install virtual environment
bash create_venv.sh

# activate virtual environment 
source venv_imagesearch/bin/activate
```


### 2. Data
A zip file of the [Oxford-17 flowers image dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/) called `flowers.zip` is in the `data` directory, and should be unzipped to run the script. The script can also be run on a different set of images with the following extensions .jpg, .JPG, .jpeg, .JPEG, .png, .PNG,  by setting the â€”path argument (see below). 

```bash
# unzip files
cd data
unzip flowers.zip
cd ..
```

### 3.1. Image search using color histograms: img_search_histogram.py

The script should be run from the `src/` directory:
```bash
# move into src directory before running the script
cd src/

# running script on default parameters
python3 img_search_histogram.py

# running script with specified parameters
python3 img_search_histogram.py -t image_0002.jpg
```

__Parameters:__
- `-d, --directory`: *str, optional, default:*  `../data/flowers`\
  Path to directory where images are stored. Note that running default requires unzipping flowers.zip files (see above). 

- `-t, --target_img`: *optional, default:* `image_0001.jpg`\
  Target image, for which all other images should be compared to find the most similar ones. 


__Output__ saved in `/out`:
- `{target_img}_hist.csv`\
  CSV file with filenames and chi-square distances of all images to the target image

- `{target_img}_hist_top3.png`\
  Image with target image and 3 most similar images. 


### 3.2. Image search using image embeddings: img_search_embeddigs.py

The script should be run from the `src/` directory:
```bash
# move into src directory before running the script
cd src/

# running script on default parameters
python3 img_search_embeddings.py

# running script with specified parameters
python3 img_search_embeddings.py -t image_0002.jpg
```

__Parameters:__
- `-d, --directory`: *str, optional, default:*  `../data/flowers`\
  Path to directory where images are stored. Note that running default requires unzipping flowers.zip files (see above). 

- `-t, --target_img`: *optional, default:* `image_0001.jpg`\
  Target image, for which all other images should be compared to find the most similar ones. 

- `-k, --k_neighbors`: *optional, default:* `20`\
  Number of k neighbors to extract and save distances for. 


__Output__ saved in `/out`:
- `{target_img}_embeddings.csv`\
  CSV file with filenames and cosine distances of k nearest images to the target image. 

- `{target_img}_embeddings_top3.png`\
  Image with target image and 3 most similar images.


## Results and Discussion 
Both scripts were used to find similar images to two different target images (displayed below). From these examples, it can be seen that image search using color histograms could identify images which are fairly similar in e.g. their color. However, the use of feature embeddings actually allowed to find images of the same kind of flower. 

Color histograms cannot take into account shapes, textures or any spatial relations. However, feature embeddings can take into account more complex aspects of images, such as shapes, textures and spatial relations. Thus, color histograms may be useful to identify identical images, as they will have the same color distribution, but feature embeddings are more useful to find rather semantically similar images.
