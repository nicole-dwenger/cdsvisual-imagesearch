# Image Search 

> Image search using (1) color histograms and (2) features embeddings.

This repository contains scripts for two different methods to search for and find similar images: (1) using color histograms and (2) using feature embeddings extracted the pretrained CNN VGG16. The aim of developing scripts for two different methods allows comparison of their their outputs, which is discussed below. Finding similar images can have simple, practical motivations, e.g. sorting images, but it can also be used for e.g. image recommendation. 

## Methods

1. **Image Search using Color Histograms**: Images can be represented by their distribution of color. In an RGB color space, color histograms display the how often each pixel intensity (between 0-255) occurs in each of the three color channels for a given image. These distributions can be compared using different distance metrics. The script in this repository extracts color distributions of each of the images and identifies similar images using the chi-square distance measure.

2. **Image Search using Image Embeddings**: Pretrained CNNs can be used to extract image embeddings. In other words, we use the pretrained weights to represent each image in a complex and dense feature space, i.e. in a vector. These vectors can be compared to find images which are visually similar. The script in this repository extracts features of each image using the pretrained CNNs VGG16 and finds similar images using the k-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm. 
 
## Usage 

! The scripts have only been tested on Linux, using Python 3.6.9. 

### 1. Cloning the Repository and Installing Dependencies

To run the scripts, I recommend cloning this repository and installing necessary dependencies in a virtual environment. The bash script `create_venv.sh` can be used to create this virtual environment with all necessary dependencies, listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The following commands can be used:

```bash
# cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/nicole-dwenger/cdsvisual-imagesearch.git

# move into directory
cd cdsvisual-imagesearch

# install virtual environment
bash create_vision_venv.sh

# activate virtual environment 
source venv_imagesearch/bin/activate
```

### 2. Data

Both image search scripts were run on the [Oxford-17 flowers image dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/). A zip file of this dataset callsed `flowers.zip` is in the `data` directory, and should be unzipped to run the script. If you wish to run the script on your own image files, they should have one of the following extensions (.jpg, .JPG, .jpeg, .JPEG, .png, .PNG), and the `--path` argument needs to be specified when running the script (see below). 

```bash
# unzip files
cd data
unzip flowers.zip
cd ..
```

### 3. Running the Scripts

#### Image Search Using Color Histograms: `img_search_histogram.py`

The script should be run from the src directory:
```bash
# move into src directory before running the script
cd src/

# running script on default parameters
python3 img_search_histogram.py

# running script with specified parameters
python3 img_search_histogram.py -t image_0002.jpg
```

__Parameters:__ 
- *-d, --directory : str, optional, default:*  `../data/flowers`\
  Path to directory where images are stored. Note that running default requires unzipping flowers.zip files (see above). 

- *-t, --target_img : optional, default:* `image_0001.jpg`\
  Target image, for which all other images should be compared to find the most similar ones. 

__Output:__

The following output will be saved in a directory called `/out`:

- *{target_img}_hist.csv:*\ 
  .csv file with filenames and chi-square distances of all images to the target image

- *{target_img}_hist_top3.png:*\
  image with target image and top3 closest images 

Example output for three images is provided in the `/out` directory.


#### Image Search Using Image Embeddings: `img_search_embeddigs.py`

The script should be run from the src directory:
```bash
# move into src directory before running the script
cd src/

# running script on default parameters
python3 img_search_embeddings.py

# running script with specified parameters
python3 img_search_embeddings.py -t image_0002.jpg
```

__Parameters:__ 
- *-d, --directory : str, optional, default:*  `../data/flowers`\
  Path to directory where images are stored. Note that running default requires unzipping flowers.zip files (see above). 

- *-t, --target_img : optional, default:* `image_0001.jpg`\
  Target image, for which all other images should be compared to find the most similar ones. 

- *-k, --k_neighbors : optional, default:* `20`\
  Number of k neighbors to extract and save distances for. 

__Output:__

The following output will be saved in a directory called `/out`:

- *{target_img}_embeddings.csv:*\
  .csv file with filenames and cosine distances of k nearest images to the target image. 

- *{target_img}_embeddings_top3.png:*\
  Image with target image and 3 most similar images.

Example output for two images is provided in the `/out` directory.

## Results and Discussion 

Both scripts have been run two images of the flowers dataset. These images and the three most similar images that have been identified using color histograms and image embeddings are displayed below. From these examples, it can be seen that image search using color histograms can find images of flowers which are fairly similar in e.g. their color. However, only comparison of feature embeddings actually allows finding images of flowers of the same kind.  

Color histrograms can not take into account shapes, textures or any spatial relations. Feature embeddings can take into account more complex aspects of images, such as shapes, textures and spatial relations. Thus, color histograms may be useful to identify identical images, as they will have the same color distribution, but to find rather semantically similar images, feature embeddings might be more useful.
